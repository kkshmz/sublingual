# SCSS Utils

Small set of mixins and extendable classes for the most basic SASS Stuff. I recommend you use it with [LibSass](http://libsass.org/) as it is screaming fast.

This is basically a subset of [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) along with a couple of things that Bourbon didn't have.

# Install

Several ways to do this. A few are listed below:

### NPM Install It

```
npm install paulcpederson/scss-utils --save-dev
```

If you do it this way, you can use with [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#command-line-interface). Just use `--include-path node_modules/scss-utils/`.

### Clone It

```
git clone git@github.com:paulcpederson/scss-utils.git path/to/your/sass/
```

If you do that, you should probably add the folder to your project's gitignore.

## Drag and Drop It

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/paulcpederson/scss-utils/releases).
2. Click the button to download a zip.
3. Decompress and drop in your SCSS folder.

## Use

Whatever install method you used, now you can just:

```
@import 'scss-utils';
```

#### Animation

The animation mixin allows you to declare cross-browser animations:

```scss
box:hover {
  @include animation(scale 1.0s ease-in, slide 2.0s ease);
}
```

Or, use individual animation mixins:

```scss
box:hover {
  @include animation-name(scale, slide);
  @include animation-duration(2s);
  @include animation-timing-function(ease);
  @include animation-iteration-count(infinite);
}
```

#### Appearance

The `appearance` CSS property is used to display an element using a platform-native styling based on the operating system's theme. For example, to remove browser specific styling for a ui element, use:

```scss
@include appearance(none);
```

#### Box-Sizing

Set the `box-sizing` property for all browsers (with browser prefixes):

```scss
@include box-sizing(border-box);
```

Valid values are `content-box`, `border-box`, and `inherit`.

#### Box-Shadow

Set the `box-shadow` property for all browsers (with browser prefixes):

```scss
@include box-shadow(10px 10px 5px #888888);
```

#### Calc

Shorthand for setting a property to use a `calc` value. Pass the property you'd like to set, then the value you'd like to use:

```scss
@include calc(width, '100px - 10%');
```

#### Clearfix

Applies a clear for floated elements:

```scss
@include clearfix();
```

#### Keyframes

For creating animations, you can use the `keyframes` mixin. This mixin accepts an animation name. Then inside the mixin, write your animation as a content block:

```scss
@include keyframes(ANIMATION_NAME) {
  0%   { background-color: #ffccf2; }
  100% { background-color: #ccffff; }
};
```

Now you can use the [animation mixin](#animation) as a named animation like this:

```
.animation-class {
  @include animation( @include animation(ANIMATION_NAME 200ms ease-in);)
}
```

#### Placeholder

Write styles for placeholder attributes:

```
.my-input {
  @include placeholder(){
    color: red;
  }
}
```

You can obviously use this outside of a class as well to style all placeholders.

#### Prefixer

This is one of the most flexible mixins in the library. Use it to add browser prefixes to a property:

```scss
@include prefixer(margin-end, 5%, webkit moz spec);
```

In this way you can prefix any property. Adding the `spec` as the last argument will also output the property *without* a prefix.

#### Respond To

The `respond-to` mixin adds media queries for use in responsive design. The mixin accepts three arguments: maximum size, minimum size, and type (screen, print, etc). You can pass just the first out of convenience. This mixin works well if you save your breakpoints as variables:

```scss
.my-div {
  @include respond-to($small){
    padding: 1rem;
  }
}
```

This will compile to the following css:

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  .my-div {
    padding: 1rem;
  }
}
```

You can assemble more complicated media queries by using both min and max:

```
@include respond-to($large, $medium) { ... }
```

This will add styles that only appear *between* the `$medium` and `$large` screen sizes.

#### Transform

The CSS transform property lets you modify the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model. Using it, elements can be translated, rotated, scaled, and skewed according to the values set. `transform`, `transform-origin`, and `transform-style` all add the necessary browser prefixes for interacting with their respective transform properties.

```scss
@include transform(translateY(50px));
@include transform(scale(0.9) rotate(-3deg));
@include transform-origin(center top);
@include transform-style(preserve-3d);
```

#### Transition

This mixin provides a shorthand syntax and supports multiple transitions.

```scss
@include transition(all 2.0s ease-in-out);
@include transition(opacity 1.0s ease-in 0s, width 2.0s ease-in 2s);
```

Or you can use the individual transition properties:

```
@include transition-property(transform);
@include transition-duration(1.0s);
@include transition-timing-function(ease-in);
@include transition-delay(0.5s);
```

#### Transition Prefixed

To transition vendor-prefixed properties, e.g. `-webkit-transform` and `-moz-transform`, there is an additional convinience `transition-prefixed()` mixin:

```
@include transition-prefixed(transform3d(0,0,0) 200ms linear);
```

This will generate vendor prefixed properties *and* values.

#### Visibility

The visibility mixins change the `visibility` property. This is useful for removing and adding elements at certain breakpoints or with certain class names. No arguments are passed. Invisible sets `visibility: hidden` on the object, leaving in the in document flow, but removing it from view. `hide()` will completely remove the item with `display:none`.

```scss
@include hide();
@include invisible();
@include visible();
```
