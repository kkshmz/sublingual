# SCSS-CLI

SCSS-CLI has been deprecated. Since my [pull-request to node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/pull/838) got merged, you can accomplish multiple file compilation within [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) itself! Any version you `npm install` starting with the [v3.0.0-beta.7 release](https://github.com/sass/node-sass/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.7) will have these capabilities.

The way you pass multiple files is a bit different in that you don't pass a glob, but rather a full directory, like this: `node-sass sass/ -o css/`

# Install

Just install node-sass:

```
npm install node-sass@beta
```

Once v3.0.0 is released to npm you will be able to `npm install node-sass` sans `@beta`
